# SDOT: Spatial Cell Type Deconvolution by Optimal Transport

This repository contains R implementation of the algorithms proposed in "Spatial Cell Type Deconvolution by Optimal Transport", under review by the International Conferenceon Machine Learning (ICML). Do not distribute.

* **run_sdot.R** => shows how to solve the SDOT algorithm on a sample data obtained from mouse brain
* **/SDOT/sdot.R** => contains the implementation and supplementary codes for running SDOT
* **/SDOT/helper.R** => contains the helper functions for processing data
* **/Data**  => contains sample single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial data for testing the algorithms.
