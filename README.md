# SDOT: Spatial Cell Type Deconvolution by Optimal Transport

This repository contains R implementation of the algorithms proposed in "Spatial Cell Type Deconvolution by Optimal Transport", under review by the International Conferenceon Machine Learning (ICML). Do not distribute.

* **run_sdot.R** => Shows how to run the SDOT algorithm on a sample data.
* **/SDOT/sdot.R** => Contains the implementation and supplementary codes for running SDOT.
* **/SDOT/helper.R** => Contains the helper functions for processing data.
* **/Data**  => Contains sample single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial data obtained from mouse brain for testing the algorithms. The datasets are down-sampled to 500 genes and ~20,000 cells in the scRNA-seq data, and 500 genes and ~300 spots in the spatial data.
